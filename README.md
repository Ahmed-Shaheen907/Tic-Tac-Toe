This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid, with the game handling player turns and win conditions. The interface is styled for a visually appealing layout.


- DOM Manipulation:
  -  learned how to select and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript.
  -  used methods like `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`, and `getElementsByClassName` to select elements.
  -  changed the text content of elements using the `textContent` property.

- Event Handling:
  -  implemented event handling for user interactions, such as clicks on game board cells and button clicks.
  -  added event listeners to DOM elements using the `addEventListener` method.
  -  removed event listeners using the `removeEventListener` method.

- Game Logic:
  -  implemented the game logic for Tic Tac Toe, including alternating player turns, marking cells with player symbols, and checking for winning conditions.
  -  used arrays to represent the game board and winning combinations.

- Conditional Statements:
  -  used conditional statements (`if...else`) to determine player turns, check for winning conditions, and handle game resets.

- Loops:
  -  used loops (`forEach`, `for...of`) to iterate over collections of elements and arrays.
  -  looped through game board cells to add event listeners and check for winning conditions.

- CSS Styling:
  -  styled the game interface using CSS to create a visually appealing layout.
  -  applied CSS classes to elements to control their appearance and layout.

- Debugging:
  -  debugged issues in the code, such as event listener attachment and text content updating.

- Utility Functions:
  -  implemented utility functions, such as checking for event listeners on elements.

- Project Structure:
  -  structured the project with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  -  linked these files together using HTML `<script>` and `<link>` tags.

Overall, this project provided hands-on experience with front-end web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic implementation, and debugging. It helped reinforce JavaScript fundamentals and provided practical insights into building interactive web applications.
